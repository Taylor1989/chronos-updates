   |     Chronos V0.3.1 Changelog       |
   ++                                  ++
    +----------------------------------+

Notable Changes:
 - New Demosaic algorithm based on AHD, which should improve color reproduction and reduce edge noise.
 - Standalone daemon to operate the video system, with DBus API.
 - External HDMI displays are supported at 1080p and 720p resolutions.
 - Recording speed improvements.
 - Add CinemaDNG and TIFF as save file formats.
 - Deprecate Raw 16-bit right-justified save format in favor of CinemaDNG.
 - Add a demo mode to replay a section of recorded video in a loop.
 - Add option to overlay frame statistics onto processed video formats (H.264 and TIFF).
 - Jog wheel can be used to adjust the exposure, and navigate the settings menus.
 - New window to edit the color correction matrix.
 - New video memory recovery tool to download video (slowly) in the event of a software crash.

Minutiae:
 - Add whitebalance preset for 3200K/Tungsten lighting.
 - Adjust highlighting of text when selecting text boxes.
 - Auto-record and auto-save modes independant of one another.
 - Improved algorithm to estimate framerate during file save.
 - Date format in the Utility window changed to shorten the Month string.
 - Display separate version strings for both the Application and Filesystem/Release.
 - Add crosshairs to the white balance window.
 - Add Qt stylesheet to improve UI focus visibility.
 - Main window displays exposure time in microseconds and shutter angle.
 - The 'close' button on the soft keyboard now also applies the entered text.
 - Reorganization of the numeric soft keyboard to include a negative key.

Fixed Bugs:
 - Crash causing the video to freeze after approximately 45 recording attempts.
 - Trigger delays would scale incorrectly when using segmented recording mode.
 - Abort recordings when the free space drops below 20MB to avoid crashing when the disk is full.
 - UI bug causing the selected save location to always select the first mounted disk.
 - First frame of a raw recording would contain corrupted NV12 image data.
 - First pixel of a Raw 12-bit packed frame was sometimes being dropped.
 - Corrupted pixels at the end of a Raw 12-bit packed frame.
 - Black areas of the UI become transparent after HDMI hotplug.
 - HDMI hotplug while on the playback window would revert to live display.
 - Add missing ColorMatrix1 and CalibrationIlluminant1 tags to CinemaDNG encoding.
 - Fix a possible crash of the video system when aborting a file save.
 - Fix a possible crash of the UI when rapidly aborting and re-starting a file save.
 - Fix color correction math so that saturating the image sensor tends towards white.

Compatibility Issues:
 - The pixel packing order in Raw 12-bit mode has been changed for the v0.3.1 release.
   Given a pair of two 12-bit pixels in hexidecmal as (0x123, 0xabc), the bytes produced
   by the Raw 12-bit packing mode changes as follows:
     v0.3.0 and earlier: (0xab, 0xc1, 0x23)
     v0.3.1 and later: (0x23, 0x1c, 0xab)

Known Bugs:
 - The first frame of an H.264 recording is erroneously copied from the display buffer before the recording starts.

Features added and bugs fixed since 0.2:

Notable Changes:
- White balance can be selected from 5 common presets in addition to taking your own as you could previously.
- Custom White Balance calibration (via Set White Balance) now works as expected, and produces vastly more realistic colours.
- Colour reproduction is greatly improved, especially reds.
- Set White Balance now calculates against 80% brightness white instead of 100% brightness white.
- File size warning when saving are generally more reliable now. (eg., 4+GB file warning now FAT32-only, since only FAT32 has a 4GB file size limit.)
- Changes to video saving settings are now applied as they are made, not just when the popup is closed.
- Keyboard behavior improved; text is now selected when you tap an edit box.
- UI can be flipped upside-down, or set to display the main screen menu on the left side.
- You can configure the "Unsaved video in RAM" popup that appears when you hit the record button with an unsaved video in memory. It can be set to "Always", "If not reviewed" (default), or "Never". The previous behavior was always "If not reviewed".
- The sliders on main screen the play screen have been made larger for ease of grabbing.
- Trigger I/O's Trigger delay input was moved to the Trigger Delay screen. A slider has been added as a visual aid and an alternate way to adjust the trigger delay. The ratio between post-trigger frames and record length in frames is kept constant between resolution and framerate changes.
- Added Trigger Delay screen and Record Modes screen, accessible from Record Settings. Selectable modes are Normal, Segmented, and Gated Burst.
- Black cal duration reduced by 10s to 15s or so at max resolution.
- Use any SD card. Previously, a class 10 SD card was required. You can now use slower cards. Of course, using a slower SD card means that videos save slower too.
- You can now auto-record after saving and/or auto-save after recording. This can loop if both are used at the same time.

Minutiae:
- Playback screen has 'region to be saved' marked. Each region saved is marked in a different color.
- There is now a Settings tab in the Util pages. This can be used to backup, restore, or reset settings, which does not include black calibration.
- Play -> Settings: bitsPerPixel, maxBitrate, saved file framerate, format, filename and save location are now saved as soon as they are changed instead of when the Close button is pressed.
- Mark In and Mark Out have been renamed to Mark Start and Mark End, probably just until the video seek bar is made horizontal.
- The Enter key has been changed to say Apply, since you have to press it to apply your changes on the record settings window.

Known bugs:
-The first few frames in saved videos are from the end of the recording.
-The camera will freeze after saving approximately 45 videos.  Make sure to reboot before saving approximately 40 videos to ensure the camera does not freeze.
-The camera will freeze when saving a video that is over 4GB onto a FAT32 partition, or when storage is full.
-If auto-record is enabled, but auto-save is not, a new recording will not be started.  However, the camera will still auto-record after booting the camera.
-Warnings about filesize (over fat32 limit, or insufficient free space) can still be shown even if autosave is enabled (if autosave is enabled, the user is unlikely to be there to press Yes for the camera to continue saving)

Installation instructions:

    Unzip the Zip file into the root directory of a FAT32 formatted USB stick.
    This should result in a camUpdate folder in the root directory of the stick.
    Boot up the camera and insert the USB stick.
    Backup your calibration data. Tap "Backup calibration data" and wait for this to complete (about 5 seconds). The cal data is now backed up on the USB drive as cal_[serial number].tar
    To install the update, tap Apply Software Update.
    A message box should pop up indicating the software update was found. Tap Yes to install the update.
    The screen will go black, you may see a screen saying "updating", and the update will be installed. This will take about 30 seconds, potentially longer depending on the speed of the USB drive. There's no feedback that anything is happening, just give it time. The camera will restart at the end of this process.
    Done!
